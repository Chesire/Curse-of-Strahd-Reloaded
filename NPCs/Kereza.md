## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Kereza is a tough, paranoid scout who sees threats everywhere. She is quick to challenge strangers and suspicious of outsiders.

**To those she trusts:** Kereza is a dedicated defender of Barovia who cares deeply about the village's safety, even if her methods seem harsh.

**Deep down:** Kereza's paranoia is not unfounded—the siege has proven that real threats exist. She is trying to prevent more losses by being hypervigilant.

### Morale in Combat

In a fight, Kereza fights to defend the barricade and protect her neighbors. She is a trained scout and fighter, though not exceptionally powerful.

### Relationships

- **[[Korga]]:** Her fellow scout and partner. They work well together.
- **[[Ismark Kolyanovich]]:** The village leader to whom she reports. She respects his leadership, though she thinks he's too trusting.
- **The Players:** Initially suspects them of being undead in disguise; gradually trusts them if they prove themselves.

## Background & History

### As a Scout

Kereza has served as a village scout for several years, patrolling the roads and edges of Barovia to watch for threats. She has seen enough danger—dire wolves, wandering undead, Strahd's servants—to justify her paranoid outlook.

### During the Siege

During the siege, Kereza worked tirelessly, standing watch on the barricades and warning of approaching undead. She lost companions in the fighting and carried the weight of every loss.

### Role in the Campaign

Kereza is one of the first NPCs the players meet, challenging them as they approach the village. She demonstrates the legitimate paranoia and fear that has gripped Barovia. After [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] vouches for the players, she gradually becomes less hostile, though she never fully relaxes her suspicion.
