## Appearance

Mary is a plain, tired-looking woman of middle age. Her hair is tied back with a wrinkled white bandana, often coming loose from stress. Her wide eyes dart with fearful energy, and her face is pale and drawn. She wears a tattered and threadbare cloak over simple clothes. Her features show signs of constant worry and interrupted sleep.

During her search for Gertruda, she appears distraught, with dried tears staining her cheeks and her hands wringing nervously.

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance

Mary should inspire:
- **Sympathy** for her loss and her desperate search for her daughter
- **Empathy** for her maternal fears and grief
- **Comfort** through reassurance and action
- **Sadness** for her helplessness against Strahd's power

### Emotions

Mary most often feels: **anxious**, **grieving**, **fearful**, **protective**, **desperate**, and **heartbroken**

### Motivations

Mary wants to:
- Find her daughter and bring her home safely
- Protect Gertruda from the dangers of the world
- Understand what happened to her daughter
- Preserve what's left of her family

### Inspirations

When playing Mary, channel:
- **Molly Weasley** (*Harry Potter*) — protective, maternal, worried
- **Sarah Newlin** (*True Blood*) — protective of her family, fearful of outside forces
- **Carol Peletier** (*The Walking Dead*) — driven by maternal protection and grief

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Mary is a worried, grieving widow who has lost everything except her daughter. She clings to the hope that Gertruda can be found.

**To those she trusts:** Mary is a woman broken by loss and fear. She has already lost her husband; losing her daughter would be the final blow.

**Deep down:** Mary blames herself for Gertruda's disappearance. She was too protective, which drove Gertruda to rebellion. She was not protective enough, which allowed her daughter to escape and come to harm.

### Morale in Combat

Mary is not a combatant. She would flee or hide rather than fight, and she would be a liability in combat.

### Relationships

- **[[Gertruda]]:** Her daughter. Mary loves her deeply and is consumed by worry for her safety. She feels responsible for Gertruda's disappearance.
- **Her Deceased Husband:** Lost years ago. His death left her a widow and hardened her protective instincts toward Gertruda.
- **[[Ireena Kolyana]]:** Her daughter's friend. She might ask the players to help [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] find Gertruda.

## Background & History

### Widowhood and Protection

Mary's husband died years before the events of the campaign, leaving her alone to raise Gertruda. His death traumatized her and made her fiercely protective of her only remaining family member. She became overprotective, trying to keep Gertruda safely within the village, away from danger.

### The Relationship with Gertruda

As Gertruda grew older, the tension between them grew. Gertruda wanted freedom and adventure; Mary wanted safety. They argued frequently, particularly after Gertruda became betrothed to [[Doru]].

When [[Doru]] led his rebellion against Castle Ravenloft and failed to return, Mary grieved for Gertruda's heartbreak. However, she also believed that perhaps [[Doru's]] death would finally convince Gertruda that the world beyond the village was dangerous and not worth pursuing.

### The Siege and the Argument

During the siege, Gertruda became obsessed with the idea that [[Doru]] could be saved, and that she could bring aid from Vallaki to help the village (and secretly, to save [[Doru]]). The night before the players' arrival in Barovia, Mary and Gertruda had a tumultuous argument that ended with both on poor terms.

Mary forbade Gertruda from traveling. Gertruda, in her desperation and idealism, refused to accept this restriction.

### The Discovery

The morning after the siege ends (the same morning the players arrive), Mary wakes to find Gertruda's bed empty and her mother's old horse, Nori, missing from the stable. She realizes that Gertruda has run away during the night.

Mary immediately becomes consumed by panic and guilt. She searches frantically but finds no sign of her daughter. In desperation, she comes to [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] to ask for help organizing a search party.

### Mary's Role in the Campaign

Mary appears to the players at the Blood of the Vine Tavern, interrupting their conversation with [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] to report Gertruda's disappearance. Her desperate plea sets the players on a quest to find Gertruda—a quest that will lead them toward discovery of Strahd's plans and Gertruda's fate in Castle Ravenloft.

### Loss and Grief

As the campaign progresses, if Gertruda is not found or if she is found dead, Mary falls into profound grief. She may become a tragic figure in the village—a mother who has lost everything.

Conversely, if Gertruda is rescued and returned to Barovia, Mary becomes a powerful advocate for the players' cause, grateful for their aid in bringing her daughter home.

## Important Notes

### Maternal Love and Guilt

Mary's overprotectiveness, while born from love, is what drives Gertruda to rebel. This creates a tragic irony: Mary's attempt to keep her daughter safe is what leads to her daughter's danger.

### The Horse

The loss of Nori, the family's old horse, is significant to Mary. This horse was likely their most valuable possession (beyond the house), and its loss is another symbol of what Gertruda's flight has cost.

### Connection to Ismark

Mary's appeal to [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] for help is telling. She shows faith in his leadership, even as many villagers blame him for the siege's losses. This can create interesting roleplaying opportunities if [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is feeling particularly guilty.

## Campaign Opportunities

### Side Quest: Search for Gertruda

Mary's plea can lead to a side quest where the players attempt to find Gertruda before she comes to harm. This quest can take them:
- Into the Svalich Woods (where they might encounter the undead or other threats)
- To Vallaki (where they can inquire about a young woman passing through)
- Eventually, to Castle Ravenloft (where they discover her true fate)

### Character Development

Mary's grief and the players' efforts (or failures) to find Gertruda can become a powerful emotional throughline for the campaign. If the players care about Mary and Gertruda, they will be motivated to defeat Strahd not just to save Barovia, but to bring a grieving mother's daughter home.
