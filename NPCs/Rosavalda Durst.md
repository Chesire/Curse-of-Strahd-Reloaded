## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Rose is Thorn's fiercest protector. Though young, she demonstrates an unusual maturity and determination to keep her brother safe at any cost.

**To those she trusts:** Rose is a lost, fearful, and traumatized young girl. She struggles with the weight of responsibility placed upon her shoulders and desperately wants to be seen as more than just a victim.

### Morale in Combat

In a fight, Rose would **plead for peace**, but **flee with Thorn if that proved impossible**. She is not a combatant—her role is protective and supportive, not martial.

### Relationships

- **Thornboldt "Thorn" Durst:** Her younger brother. Rose's entire world revolves around keeping him safe and comforted.
- **[[Walter Durst]]:** Her half-sibling. Their relationship is complicated.
- **[[Elisabeth Durst]] and [[Gustav Durst]]:** Her parents. Rose remembers them with a mix of love and the trauma of Death House.
- **[[Klara]]:** Her nursemaid (known to Rose as "Miss Klara"). Rose has memories of the nursemaid recorded in her diary.

## Background & History

### Life Before Death House

In life, Rose was a budding wizard who discovered a small spellbook in her father's library. She took great care in copying the cantrips *mending*, *light*, and *shocking grasp* into her diary. Her aged and faded diary also contains entries regarding her studies, her friends, her younger brother [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]], and arguments between her mother and father. Rose doesn't know the true nature of those fights.

### Current Status

Rose exists as a ghostly spirit within Death House. She and her brother are trapped but not malevolent—they remain protective of each other and cautious of the house's darker forces.
