## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Ireena is a compassionate, curious, yet stubborn young noblewoman. She stands beside her brother with quiet strength and speaks with intelligence and warmth.

**To those she trusts:** Ireena is an anxious, yet determined young woman who dreams of freedom and adventure beyond the mists of Barovia. She carries deep guilt about the siege and fears her own existence endangers those she loves.

**Deep down:** Ireena wonders whether giving herself up to Strahd would be the best way to protect those she loves. This dark thought haunts her, though she fights it fiercely.

### Morale in Combat

In a fight, Ireena will always turn to words before drawing her rapier. If necessary to defend herself, though, she'll draw her blade—reluctantly if protecting herself, and proudly if defending another.

### Relationships

- **[[Ismark Kolyanovich]]:** Her adoptive brother. She loves him deeply and is heartbroken that he must remain in Barovia while she travels to Vallaki.
- **[[Kolyan Indirovich]]:** Her adoptive father (deceased). He found her in the Svalich Wood as a child and loved her as his own.
- **Korina Targolova:** Her adoptive mother (deceased). Ireena cherishes memories of her and wears her red scarf.
- **[[Strahd von Zarovich]]:** The vampire who marked her. She doesn't understand his interest in her or what he wants.
- **[[Gertruda]]:** A village girl and friend. Ireena is deeply concerned about her disappearance.
- **[[Doru]]:** A friend from the village; now a vampire spawn imprisoned in the church undercroft.

## Background & History

### Origins (Unknown)

Ireena was found as a young girl by [[Kolyan Indirovich]] near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft, on the edge of the Svalich Wood. She has no memory of her life before being found. [[Kolyan Indirovich]] and his wife, Korina Targolova, took her in and raised her as their own daughter, treating her with the same love and care they gave [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]].

Before her death fourteen years ago, Korina buried a small wooden chest beneath an old tree on Lugdana's Knoll—a place of special significance to the family. Inside was a silver bracelet engraved with the name "Tatyana" and a message from parents: "May you find your path, and may you find light even in the darkest places."

### Life in Barovia

Ireena grew up in the village of Barovia, curious and intelligent. She learned swordsmanship from [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], was trained in healing arts by the village healer, and spent countless hours reading and learning about the world beyond the mists. She dreamed of one day traveling to distant lands and experiencing the wonders described in books.

She was particularly close with [[Gertruda]], a village girl, and the two bonded over the loss of their mothers. When [[Doru]] and his rebellion departed for Castle Ravenloft, Ireena worried for his safety, though [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] assured her the quest was hopeless.

### The Siege and Strahd's Mark

During the siege of Barovia, Ireena defended the village's southern barricade. When she returned to the burgomaster's mansion to retrieve crossbow bolts, she found her father inviting someone inside—though his voice sounded strangely calm and compelled.

A tall, gaunt figure with burning red eyes entered the mansion. The figure—Strahd von Zarovich himself—spoke to her in a resonant voice, and her memory went blank. When she awakened, her father was dead and she bore the bite marks of a vampire on her neck.

Since then, Ireena has been traumatized by two competing fears: the terror of what Strahd might do to her, and the crushing guilt that her father's death is somehow her fault. She also wonders if the superstition about red-haired women bringing bad luck is true.

### After the Siege

With her father dead and Strahd's clear interest in her, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] insists that Ireena leave Barovia for Vallaki, where she might find sanctuary in St. Andral's Church. Though she initially resists—wanting to help rebuild the village—she eventually agrees to go, primarily to spare [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] the pain of losing her as well.

Ireena becomes a companion to the players, using her skills in healing, sword work, and diplomacy to aid them. Her goal is to reach Vallaki safely and to understand why Strahd has marked her.

## Important Notes

### The Bracelet

The silver bracelet Ireena wears, which she offers to the players as thanks for escorting her, bears an inscription: "Tatyana: May you find your path, and may you find light even in the darkest places—Mother & Father."

The bracelet is over 300 years old and was a gift from Tatyana Federovna's parents on her eighteenth birthday. Ireena doesn't know who Tatyana is, and has no memory of how the bracelet came to be in her possession as a child. This is a significant mystery that may unfold over the campaign.

### Strahd's Interest

Strahd has taken a particular interest in Ireena, though his exact motivations are unclear to her. The vampire does not attack her—in fact, his servants and monsters never attack her. This marks her as special in some way, though Ireena cannot fathom why the Devil would want to spare her.

### As a Companion

Ireena has the statistics of an **expert sidekick** (using the base stat block of a **noble**), and carries a **light crossbow**. She also has the **Healer** feat and begins with two *healer's kits*.

When she first joins the party at 3rd level, she has 25 (5d8) hit points. She gains a level whenever the party does, ending the adventure at 10th level.
