## Appearance

Parriwimple is a hulking figure—tall and brawny with muscles that ripple beneath his tunic. His shaggy brown hair falls messily across his face, and his crooked teeth glint when he smiles. There is an innocence and immaturity to his posture that belies his considerable strength and size. He often fidgets with the hem of his tunic when nervous or uncertain. His eyes are warm and friendly, reflecting a childlike openness.

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Parriwimple is a cheerful, simple-minded young man with surprising strength. He is helpful and eager to please, though he doesn't fully grasp complex situations.

**To those he trusts:** Parriwimple is a thoughtful, insightful, yet grieving orphan. Beneath his simple demeanor lies a keen observer of human nature and a quiet wisdom born of loss.

**Deep down:** Parriwimple is desperately trying to move past his parents' deaths by proving useful to others. He fears that his simplicity makes him a burden, and he works hard to contribute and feel valued.

### Morale in Combat

In a fight, Parriwimple would hold up his hands and plead for peace first. However, if ignored or if his uncle [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] were endangered, he would fight with righteous fury, using his considerable strength to restrain or overpower combatants.

### Relationships

- **[[Bildrath Cantemir]]:** His uncle. Parriwimple loves him deeply, though he doesn't always understand [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath's]] bitterness and anger. He works hard to help [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] and keep him safe.
- **Marta:** His mother (deceased). Parriwimple remembers her with love and still grieves her loss.
- **Dragomir:** His father (deceased). Parriwimple loved him and was proud to be his son.
- **[[Doru]]:** A friend from before the rebellion. Parriwimple missed him greatly and was sad when he didn't return.
- **The Players:** Potential friends and allies, whom he quickly becomes attached to

## Background & History

### Early Life

Parriwimple was born to Marta and Dragomir in Barovia. His parents were good people—Marta was [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath's]] sister, and Dragomir was a hardworking man devoted to his family. Parriwimple grew up loved and cared for, though his mind developed differently than other children's.

Despite his simplicity, Parriwimple was strong—unusually strong for someone his age. He was capable of performing heavy physical labor and could lift things that would normally require multiple people.

### Before the Siege

Parriwimple was fond of [[Doru]] and loved to play with his monkey, which the scholar Alanik Ray had brought to the village. He was excited when [[Doru]] announced the rebellion, though he didn't fully understand what it meant. He was sad when [[Doru]] didn't return.

### During the Siege

When the siege began, Parriwimple fought alongside his parents to defend the village. He was brave and strong, but his parents protected him—they feared for his safety even as they fought the undead.

On the second night of the siege, Marta and Dragomir were killed in a fierce assault. Parriwimple survived, but he was devastated. His world—simple and clear as it had been—suddenly became incomprehensible. He didn't understand why his parents had to die, or why the world was so cruel.

### After the Siege

With both his parents dead, Parriwimple was taken in fully by his uncle [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]. Though [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] is gruff and often sharp-tongued, Parriwimple knows his uncle cares for him. He works hard in the store, helps with inventory, and tries to be useful to repay his uncle's kindness.

However, Parriwimple is grieving. He misses his parents deeply and wonders why they had to leave him. He channels his grief into helping others, believing that if he is useful enough, perhaps he can prevent others from losing their families.

## Character Mechanics

### As an Ally

Parriwimple fights with a **spear** (+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target, *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage). His statistics are those of a **berserker**, though he is not actually in a rage—his strength comes naturally from his physiology.

### Personality Quirks

- Parriwimple often forgets complex instructions and may ask for clarification
- He is easily distracted by shiny objects or interesting items
- He has a childlike sense of humor and finds simple things amusing
- He is intensely loyal to anyone who shows him kindness
- He sometimes misses social cues and may be blunt or unintentionally rude without meaning to be

## Campaign Arc

### In Act I

Parriwimple assists the players during the siege of Barovia, fighting at the eastern barricade. He develops an attachment to whichever players show him the most kindness. After the siege, he may become a temporary traveling companion if the players are kind to him.

### Later in the Campaign

If the players maintain their kindness toward Parriwimple, he may travel with them for portions of the campaign, using his strength to aid them. His perspective—innocent yet observant—may offer unexpected wisdom or comic relief at key moments.
