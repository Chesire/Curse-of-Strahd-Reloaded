As a ghost, he appears as a pale, gaunt figure with sunken, haunted eyes and trembling hands, wearing once-fine clothing now tattered with age. His remains have been transformed into a grotesque creature—a long, flesh-like worm the breadth and length of a human man, with arms and legs sewn to its torso.

## Character Information

### Persona

Gustav is a broken man—both in life and in death. He appears haunted by guilt and doubt, ridden with self-loathing. His ghost is terrified of [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth]] and will obey her even against his will.

### Relationships

- **[[Elisabeth Durst]]:** His wife. Gustav fears her absolutely and shows signs of guilt and shame regarding his actions
- **[[Klara]]:** The nursemaid. An invitation found in the Cloakroom indicates there was a relationship between Gustav and Klara, leading to [[Walter Durst|Walter's]] birth
- **[[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]]:** His children
- **[[Walter Durst]]:** His illegitimate child with [[Klara]]

## Background & History

In life, Gustav Durst was a merchant of considerable wealth and standing. He was married to [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth]] and had two children with her: [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]].

Gustav had an affair with the nursemaid [[Klara]], which resulted in the birth of [[Walter Durst|Walter]]. His infidelity and the secret he kept from his wife became a source of great anguish. Clues throughout Death House reveal his relationship with Klara—an invitation to a Durst family celebration addressed to "Lady Lovina Wachter" was found with love notes signed by "G."

In death, Gustav became enslaved to his wife's will. His flayed corpse was transformed into a grotesque creature known as a **boneless**—a creation found in the Cult Leader's Quarters. His ghost appears during the escape sequence, desperately trying to prevent the players from leaving, insisting that they accept death rather than resist [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth's]] power.

## Key Locations & Items

The flayed remains of Gustav Durst are found as a **boneless** in a footlocker in the Cult Leader's Quarters, made of his recognizable flayed skin.
