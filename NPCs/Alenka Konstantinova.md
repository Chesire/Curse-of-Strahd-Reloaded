## Appearance

Alenka is a plain, tired-looking woman with unkempt wavy brown hair tied back with a wrinkled white bandana. Her face is pale and drawn, with haunted eyes that speak of recent loss and trauma.

### Resonance

Alenka should inspire:
- **Sympathy** for her devastating loss
- **Concern** for her descent into desperate thinking
- **Understanding** of her grief-driven actions
- **Sadness** for what loss has made her become

### Emotions

Alenka most often feels: **grieving**, **desperate**, **paranoid**, **angry**, **accusatory**, and (occasionally) **broken**

### Motivations

Alenka wants to:
- Find her missing brother and sister-in-law
- End the siege through any means possible
- Make someone answer for her family's disappearance
- Restore order and safety to her world

### Inspirations

When playing Alenka, channel:
- **Lady Stoneheart** (*Game of Thrones*) — driven by grief and desire for vengeance
- **Hannah Baker** (*13 Reasons Why*) — broken by trauma, accusatory
- **Cersei Lannister** (*Game of Thrones*) — protective instincts twisted by loss and paranoia

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Alenka is a grief-stricken woman on the edge of madness, willing to do terrible things to end the siege and make sense of her loss.

**To those she trusts:** Alenka is a broken woman desperately searching for her family and grasping at any solution, no matter how terrible.

**Deep down:** Alenka is a good person driven to desperation by unimaginable loss. She is not evil—she is traumatized, terrified, and willing to sacrifice the innocent because she cannot bear her own pain.

### Morale in Combat

Alenka is not a fighter. She would flee if directly threatened, but she will stand her ground if she believes she is protecting her community or achieving her goals.

### Relationships

- **Anton Konstantinovich:** Her brother (missing, presumed imprisoned in Castle Ravenloft). His disappearance drives all of her actions.
- **Dezdrelda Konstantinova:** Her sister-in-law (missing, presumed imprisoned in Castle Ravenloft). She grieves for her as well.
- **[[Kolyan Indirovich]]:** The burgomaster who refused her desperate plea. She resents him for choosing mercy over sacrifice.
- **[[Ireena Kolyana]]:** The young woman Alenka wants to sacrifice. She sees [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] as an outsider and potential bargaining chip.
- **The Mob:** The frightened villagers she has gathered to support her plan. They are desperate and grieving like her.

## Background & History

### Before the Siege

Alenka lived quietly in Barovia with her family. Her brother Anton was married to Dezdrelda, and they had a stable life together. The family was close, and Alenka cared deeply for both her brother and sister-in-law.

When Doru's rebellion occurred, the family was concerned but not directly involved. They hoped the siege would not come to Barovia, and that Strahd would remain satisfied with his distant rule.

### During the Siege

Two nights into the siege, Anton and Dezdrelda mysteriously vanished from their home in the middle of the night. Their bodies were never found. Alenka was left not knowing what happened to them—were they killed? Taken prisoner? Transformed into undead?

The loss was catastrophic. Alenka was consumed by grief and confusion. As the siege continued and more villagers were killed, her grief twisted into desperate action and paranoid speculation.

### The Legend of Red-Haired Women

In her desperation, Alenka latched onto a superstition: young women with red hair bring bad luck and are often targeted by vampires. In Barovian folklore, it is said that the Devil Strahd enjoys preying upon red-haired women.

Looking at [[Ireena Kolyana]] with her distinctive red hair, Alenka became convinced that if they were to offer her to Strahd as a sacrifice or appeasement, the vampire might be satisfied and the siege would end. It was irrational thinking born of desperation, but it consumed her.

### The Mob at the Mansion

Alenka gathered a mob of other frightened villagers—people who had lost loved ones and were desperate for any solution—and marched on the burgomaster's mansion. She demanded that [[Kolyan Indirovich]] surrender [[Ireena Kolyana]].

[[Kolyan Indirovich]] refused, declaring them fools and reminding them that "we are Barovians. We do not turn on our own."

Alenka, in her grief-driven desperation, pushed back, noting that [[Ireena Kolyana]] was not truly Barovian anyway—Kolyan had found her in the woods as a child.

### The Players' Intervention

If the players intervene in this scene, they can convince the mob to disperse through either persuasion (showing empathy for Alenka's loss) or intimidation (displaying overwhelming force). A successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, made with advantage if the players show Alenka genuine sympathy for her missing family members, will cause the mob to break up.

### After the Scene

If the mob is dispersed without violence, Alenka is left with her grief but alive and able to reflect on her actions. She may later feel shame for her moment of desperation, particularly if the players help her learn the truth about her brother.

If the mob encounters violence, Alenka may flee or be incapacitated. Her fate beyond this moment depends on the players' actions.

## Important Lore

### The Truth About Anton and Dezdrelda

Unbeknownst to Alenka, her brother Anton and sister-in-law Dezdrelda are prisoners of **Volenta Popofsky**, one of Strahd's vampiric brides, in Castle Ravenloft. They are trapped and being used as servants and sustenance for the vampire.

The players may encounter Anton later in the campaign (specifically in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil#Volenta's Toy|Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]]), where he has been reduced to a masked servant under Volenta's control.

If the players discover this truth and share it with Alenka, it will be devastating—but it may also redeem her actions, showing that her instincts about her family's fate were correct, even if her proposed solution was wrong.

## Campaign Role

### Moral Complexity

Alenka is not an enemy the players should destroy. She is a tragic figure driven to desperation by legitimate trauma. Her attempted mob action can be a powerful dramatic moment that forces the players to think about the moral complexities of the siege and Strahd's impact on Barovia.

### Redemption Potential

If the players handle the mob scene with compassion, Alenka can become an NPC with whom they have a meaningful relationship. She may later provide aid, information, or emotional gratitude.

### Later Encounter

If the players ever learn the truth about what happened to Anton and Dezdrelda, they can seek out Alenka and share this information. This encounter could be profoundly moving and could create a powerful moment of reconciliation or shared grief.
