He carries himself with the bearing of a leader, though his eyes often betray the weight of responsibility he carries. He wears splint armor over a collared coat, with a longsword buckled at his hip.

- Find a way to free Barovia from Strahd's tyranny
- Prove himself worthy of the Kolyanovich name despite his failures

### Inspirations

When playing Ismark, channel:
- **Jon Snow** (*Game of Thrones*) — dutiful, burdened by leadership, self-sacrificing
- **Faramir** (*Lord of the Rings*) — noble, honorable, self-doubting
- **Trevor Belmont** (*Castlevania*) — warrior, protector, reluctant hero

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Ismark is a courageous, reliable, and compassionate leader. He speaks with genuine warmth and inspires confidence through steady determination and kind words.

**To those he trusts:** Ismark is a self-doubting, struggling warrior desperate to keep his loved ones safe. He replays the siege nightly in his mind, wondering what he could have done differently.

**Deep down:** Ismark fears that he has already irreparably failed. The weight of every death during the siege rests on his shoulders. He worries he will never live up to Ismark the Great.

### Morale in Combat

In a fight, Ismark would first seek to mediate conflict. However, he would gladly draw his sword—and fight to the death—if defending something or someone he loves.

### Relationships

- **[[Ireena Kolyana]]:** His adoptive sister. He is deeply protective of her and fears for her safety now that Strahd has taken interest in her. He insists on escorting her to Vallaki.
- **[[Kolyan Indirovich]]:** His father (deceased). Ismark deeply respects his memory and seeks to honor his legacy after Strahd's attack.
- **Ismark the Great:** His great-grandfather (historical). Ismark's entire identity is shaped by the legacy of this legendary warrior.
- **The Barovians:** Ismark feels personally responsible for the losses suffered during the siege. Many now call him "Ismark the Lesser" in bitter mockery of his ancestry.
- **Muriel (Keepers of the Feather):** An omen of good fortune in Ismark's mind, though he doesn't know she is a wereraven.

## Background & History

### Before the Siege

Ismark was the eldest son of [[Kolyan Indirovich]], the Burgomaster of Barovia. He grew up hearing tales of his great-grandfather, Ismark the Great, a legendary warrior who drove back countless vampires and undead threats. Ismark trained with the sword, determined to one day match his ancestor's deeds.

When Doru led his rebellion against Castle Ravenloft three months ago, many villagers prepared to flee to Vallaki. However, Ismark delivered an inspiring speech invoking the memory of his great-grandfather, encouraging the Barovians to stand and fight for their homes. Most heeded his call—a decision that would haunt him for the rest of his life.

### During the Siege

When Strahd's siege began, Ismark worked tirelessly to organize the village's defenses. He coordinated scouts, maintained the barricades, and rallied frightened villagers to keep their spirits up. However, as the undead forces pressed harder each night, many villagers were killed or wounded.

Those who lost loved ones began to blame Ismark for his "foolish fantasy of heroism." Some even called him "Ismark the Lesser" in bitter mockery of his illustrious ancestor. This mockery cut deeper than any blade.

On the night Strahd personally invaded the village, [[Kolyan Indirovich]] was killed by the Devil himself, and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] was bitten and marked by the vampire. The trauma shattered Ismark's confidence in his leadership, though he continued to support the village's efforts to survive.

### After the Siege

With his father dead and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] now a target of Strahd's unwanted attention, Ismark finds himself in a desperate position. He asks the players for three critical favors:

1. **Escort Ireena to Vallaki** — and specifically to St. Andral's Church, which is said to be hallowed ground that protects against vampires
2. **Seek Madam Eva's wisdom** — at Tser Pool, to learn how Strahd can be defeated
3. **Help bury his father** — with proper rites to honor his memory

Ismark cannot leave Barovia himself due to his obligations as his father's successor, so he must entrust these vital tasks to the players. This decision weighs heavily on him.
