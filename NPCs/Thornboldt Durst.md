## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Thorn is a frightened young boy who clings to his sister. He appears shy and withdrawn, seeking comfort in Rose's presence.

**To those he trusts:** Thorn is a quietly observant and insightful child. Beneath his anxiety, he possesses insight and understanding beyond his years.

### Morale in Combat

In a fight, Thorn would **cower and cry, pleading for Rose to rescue him**. He is not a combatant—his role is entirely dependent on Rose's protection.

### Relationships

- **Rosavalda "Rose" Durst:** His older sister. Thorn is entirely dependent on Rose for emotional support and safety. He rarely strays far from her side.
- **Walter Durst:** His half-sibling. Thorn's relationship with Walter is unknown, though he is wary of him.
- **Elisabeth and Gustav Durst:** His parents. Thorn remembers them with a mix of love and the trauma of Death House.
- **Klara:** His nursemaid (known to Thorn as "Miss Klara"). Rose has memories of the nursemaid recorded in her diary.

## Background & History

### Life Before Death House

In life, Thorn had toys that he cherished. Small plush gray wolves with his name stitched onto their stomachs show evidence of heavy mending and patchwork—likely repaired by his sister Rose. He was particularly attached to a doll wearing a yellow lace dress, which he proudly holds in the family portrait.

### Current Status

Thorn exists as a ghostly spirit within Death House, trapped alongside his sister Rose. The two children remain bound together, with Thorn emotionally and spiritually dependent on Rose's strength and protection.
