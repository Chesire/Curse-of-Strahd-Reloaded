## Appearance

Rahadin is a tall, lithe figure with dusky complexion and long, black hair falling past his neck. His ears taper sharply upward to elven points. A long, wicked scar cuts across his forehead, above where lines of age mark his face. His dark brown eyes bear quiet awareness and a casual, almost predatory gaze.

He dresses in layers of fine armor and supple leather: a deep blue tunic trimmed with bronze beneath tough, yet flexible leather armor. A light cloak with thick white fur trim drapes across his shoulders. A curved saber hangs from a sheath at his belt, with a pair of scimitars (**Thorn** and **Chain**) strapped to his back above it. Black leather gloves cover his hands.

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance

Rahadin should inspire:
- **Fear** for his obvious martial prowess and killer's grace
- **Dread** for the screams of his victims that surround him
- **Respect** for his unwavering loyalty and professionalism
- **Unease** for his calm demeanor in the face of violence

### Emotions

Rahadin most often feels: **content**, **curious**, **amused** (at mortal struggles), **loyal**, and **cold**

### Motivations

Rahadin wants to:
- Serve [[Strahd von Zarovich]] with absolute devotion
- Eliminate threats to Strahd's rule
- Understand and test those who come to challenge his master
- Maintain the order and discipline of Strahd's domain

### Inspirations

When playing Rahadin, channel:
- **Tywin Lannister** (*Game of Thrones*) — cold, efficient, loyal to his master
- **Darth Vader** (*Star Wars*) — utterly devoted to his master, terrifyingly competent
- **The Operative** (*Serenity*) — professional killer, articulate, terrifyingly calm

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Rahadin is a cold, efficient killer serving as Strahd's chamberlain. He speaks with formal politeness while delivering threats and proclamations of doom. He shows no emotion, though occasional flickers of dark amusement betray his nature.

**To Strahd:** Rahadin is absolutely devoted, the one being whose loyalty Strahd never questions. He anticipates his master's wishes and executes them with meticulous precision.

**Deep down:** (If Rahadin has depths, they are unknown. He may be so old and so devoted that his individual personality has been subsumed entirely into his role as Strahd's instrument.)

### Morale in Combat

Rahadin is an apex predator. He does not fear mortal combat. He fights with cold precision, and he does not stop until his objectives are complete. He shows mercy only when his master commands it.

### Relationships

- **[[Strahd von Zarovich]]:** His master. Rahadin's entire existence is devoted to serving Strahd. His loyalty is absolute and unquestioning.
- **The Players:** Initially, he views them with casual contempt. If they survive long enough to become threats, his interest increases.
- **Other Servants of Strahd:** Rahadin commands respect through fear. Lesser servants obey him because they must, and because they fear his wrath more than they fear Strahd's.

## Background & History

### Ancient Origins

Rahadin's origins are shrouded in mystery. He is an ancient elf—far older than any living mortal in Barovia. How he came to serve Strahd is unknown, as are the circumstances of his enslavement (if enslavement it is, rather than willing service).

Some speculate that Rahadin is as much curse as servant—that he has been bound to Strahd through dark magic or fell covenant, condemned to serve for eternity. Others believe Rahadin truly serves by choice, having found in Strahd a master worthy of his devotion and a purpose that sustains him across the centuries.

### Role in Strahd's Service

Rahadin serves as Strahd's **chamberlain**—the second-most powerful position in Castle Ravenloft. He manages the castle's day-to-day operations, directs Strahd's minions, and carries out his master's will without question. He is the one being Strahd trusts most completely.

### During the Siege of Barovia

When Strahd declared the ninety-day countdown to the village's punishment, it was Rahadin who carried the vampire's ultimatum to the village, reading the formal proclamation before [[Kolyan Indirovich]] and the assembled Barovians.

After Strahd's personal assault on the village during the siege, Rahadin appears again—leading twelve undead in a dark procession. He reads another proclamation, offering mercy to those who accept Strahd's rule and promising death to those who resist. He then approaches [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and delivers a cold message of condolences and congratulations, hinting that [[Kolyan Indirovich]] is dead and that [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is now burgomaster.

Rahadin does not engage in direct combat unless forced to do so. He is primarily a messenger and herald, though his martial prowess is so evident that none dare to challenge him lightly.

## Combat Statistics

Rahadin is a **Challenge 14-15** combatant. He begins combat with a curved **saber** (+11 to hit), but if reduced to 0 hit points, he immediately draws his twin scimitars **Thorn** and **Chain**, transforming into an even more deadly form (**Challenge 15**).

### Screams of the Dead

Rahadin is surrounded by a psychic aura created by the thousands of people he has killed over his long life. Any creature within 10 feet of him that isn't protected by a *mind blank* spell hears in its mind the screams of these victims—a terrifying and disorienting effect.

### Notable Abilities

- **Wind Strike:** Rahadin moves swiftly in a straight line, damaging all creatures in his path
- **Whirling Blades:** A bonus action that damages all nearby creatures
- **Misty Step (Limited):** Allows him to teleport away from attacks
- **Multiple Reactions:** Rahadin can take up to three reactions per round, allowing him to respond to multiple threats

## Role in the Campaign

### In Act I

Rahadin appears as Strahd's herald, delivering messages and demonstrating that Strahd's reach extends throughout Barovia. He is a terrifying force that shows the players the true scope of Strahd's power.

### Throughout the Campaign

Rahadin remains one of Strahd's most dangerous servants. He may pursue the players at his master's command, or he may test them if Strahd becomes intrigued by their progress. He is a recurring threat that grows more dangerous as the campaign progresses.

### Against the Players

Rahadin treats the players with professional courtesy, as befits an envoy of Strahd. However, if they become troublesome or if Strahd tires of them, Rahadin is capable of dispatching them with ruthless efficiency. He fights with cold precision, showing no mercy and taking no joy in killing—it is simply what he does.

## Campaign Notes

### Personality

Rahadin speaks in a formal, almost courtly manner. He uses measured tones and carefully chosen words. When he delivers threats, they come as quiet observations rather than passionate declarations. This calm demeanor makes him far more terrifying than any ranting villain.

### Loyalty

Rahadin's absolute loyalty to Strahd is unshakeable. No appeal to his better nature, no offer of freedom, no threat will turn him from his master. He is not interested in rebellion or redemption. He exists to serve.

### Challenge Level

Rahadin is one of the most dangerous opponents the players will face before confronting Strahd himself. He is not a "boss fight" that can be easily overcome. If the players must fight him, they should be at a considerable power level, and they should recognize that victory is uncertain.
