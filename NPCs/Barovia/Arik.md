## Background & History

### As Tavern Keeper

Arik runs the Blood of the Vine Tavern, which serves as a de facto gathering place and information hub for the village. He provides food, drink, and a space for people to share news and concerns.

### The Original Vistani

In the original campaign, the Blood of the Vine Tavern is run by a group of Vistani women (Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia). However, in this version, those women have fled to Tser Pool, and Arik serves as the sole proprietor.

### During the Siege

During the siege, the tavern likely became a place where frightened villagers gathered to seek comfort and information. Arik would have remained professional and neutral, providing what help he could while maintaining his business.

### Role in the Campaign

Arik serves as a neutral tavern keeper who can provide the players with information about the village, introduce them to important NPCs, and serve as a hub for gathering information. He is not a major character, but he is an important logistical point.

## Tavern Details

### The Blood of the Vine

The tavern is a modest establishment, likely in the center of the village. It features:
- A bar where Arik serves drinks
- Wooden tables and chairs for patrons
- A hearth for warmth
- Food prepared by Arik or a cook he employs

### Atmosphere

The atmosphere of the tavern depends on where the players are in the campaign:
- During the siege: Tense, fearful, but also a refuge
- After the siege: Weary, but with some relief; a place to process what has happened
