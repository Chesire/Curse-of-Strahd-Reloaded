## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Korga is a tough, taciturn scout who speaks little and expresses emotion even less. He is all business and survival.

**To those he trusts:** Korga is a reliable, if grim, companion. He carries the weight of the siege's losses but channels it into determination to protect others.

**Deep down:** Korga has lost much in the siege and has made the decision that he will not lose more. He is prepared to fight and die to protect what remains.

### Morale in Combat

In a fight, Korga is a competent and dangerous fighter. Unlike [[Kereza]], he does not chatter or question—he simply fights with cold efficiency.

### Relationships

- **[[Kereza]]:** His fellow scout and partner. They understand each other without much need for words.
- **[[Ismark Kolyanovich]]:** The village leader to whom he is loyal and reliable.
- **The Players:** Views them with cautious neutrality; respects strength and competence.

## Background & History

### As a Scout

Korga has served as a village scout for many years, working alongside [[Kereza]]. While [[Kereza]] is paranoid and vocal about threats, Korga is quiet and observant, gathering intelligence and reporting what he sees.

### During the Siege

During the siege, Korga lost people close to him—the specifics are unknown, as he does not speak of them. The loss hardened him and deepened his already-grim outlook.

### Role in the Campaign

Korga is a minor NPC who serves as part of the barricade defense and helps establish the atmosphere of loss and trauma in Barovia. He is competent and reliable, if not particularly memorable.
