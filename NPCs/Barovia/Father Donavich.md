## Appearance

Father Donavich is a middle-aged man who looks considerably older than he is due to recent stress and lack of sleep. His hair is disheveled and graying, and his face bears the hollowed expression of someone who hasn't slept properly in weeks. He typically wears the simple black robes of a priest, though they are now stained and unkempt. His bronze sunburst holy symbol—a gift to his son [[Doru]]—is notably absent from his person, deepening his look of spiritual abandonment.

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance

Father Donavich should inspire:
- **Sympathy** for his crushing sorrow and sense of loss
- **Pity** for his separation from the Morninglord and his loss of faith
- **Endearment** for his kindness and hospitality
- **Discomfort** for his zealous condemnation of his own son's undead nature

### Emotions

In his current state, Donavich most often feels: **grief**, **guilt**, **exhaustion**, **compassion**, and **obsession**

If reconciled with [[Doru]], he most often feels: **hope**, **relief**, **gratitude**, **confusion**, **fear**, and **shame**

### Motivations

Father Donavich wants to:
- Free his son [[Doru]] from Strahd's curse—at any cost
- Reconcile with [[Doru]] before it is too late
- Restore his connection to the Morninglord and his faith
- Understand why the gods allowed such suffering to befall his child

### Inspirations

When playing Father Donavich, channel:
- **Eddard Stark** (*Game of Thrones*) — honorable, duty-bound, haunted by loss
- **Walter White** (*Breaking Bad*) — driven to extremes by love and desperation
- **Denethor** (*The Lord of the Rings*) — broken, despairing, losing grip on reality

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Father Donavich is a grieving, yet zealous priest. He speaks with the fervor of someone clinging to faith even as it slips through his fingers.

**To those he trusts:** Donavich is a broken man adrift in the world, lost and confused without guidance or purpose. He blames himself for [[Doru]]'s fall to darkness.

**Deep down:** Donavich is terrified that his son is truly dead, and that the creature wearing [[Doru]]'s skin is irredeemable. Yet he also desperately hopes that [[Doru]]'s soul might yet be saved.

### Morale in Combat

In an ordinary situation, Father Donavich would fight fiercely to defend his people and church. In his current broken state, however, he would immediately surrender, too wracked with guilt and despair to even defend his own life.

### Relationships

- **[[Doru]]:** His biological son. Donavich believes [[Doru]] is dead and only a foul beast remains, yet he desperately hopes he is wrong.
- **[[Ismark Kolyanovich]]:** A respected leader of the village; friend
- **[[Ireena Kolyana]]:** A young woman he knew as a child; he worries for her safety
- **The Morninglord:** Donavich has lost his connection to his god, believing his faith has been corrupted
- **The Barovians:** His flock, though he feels he has abandoned them in their hour of need

## Background & History

### Before the Rebellion

Father Donavich was a kind and friendly man, always ready to share a word of wisdom or offer comfort to those in need. He was devoted to the Morninglord and served as the spiritual heart of Barovia. [[Doru]] was his pride and joy—a bright, enthusiastic young man with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.

### Doru's Rebellion

Three months before the siege, [[Doru]] announced a crusade against Castle Ravenloft, proclaiming that they would free Barovia from the mists and return sunlight to the valley. Donavich was horrified by the plan and tried to dissuade his son, fearing it would bring retaliation from Strahd.

However, Donavich ultimately could not deny his son. As a token of his love and blessing, he gave [[Doru]] his most precious possession: his bronze sunburst holy symbol, hoping it might protect [[Doru]] in the darkness he was about to face.

The rebellion failed. None of the rebels returned—or so Donavich believed. He spent months grieving his lost son.

### Doru's Return

Six nights ago, as the siege of Barovia began, [[Doru]] returned to the church—but not as the son Donavich remembered. The young man had been transformed into a **vampire spawn**, his flesh pale and dead, his eyes gleaming with unholy hunger. The creature wore [[Doru]]'s face, but Donavich was convinced that his son was truly dead, and only a profane mockery remained.

Donavich managed to lure the vampire spawn into the undercroft and trap it there, sealing the trapdoor with a padlock. Since that night, he has been unable to cast spells or feel the Morninglord's presence. Donavich wrongly believes this is because [[Doru]] still wears his holy symbol, which has been corrupted by Strahd's foul influence.

### Current State

Father Donavich has not slept or bathed properly in days. The church bears marks of [[Doru]]'s initial attack, and the damage serves as a constant reminder of his failure. He spends his days in prayer—though his prayers go unanswered—and his nights listening to the sounds from the undercroft below, wondering if what he hears is truly a mindless monster or if his son still lives somewhere within.

### Reunion with Doru

If the players retrieve Donavich's holy symbol from [[Doru]] and tell him that his son still lives—that [[Doru]] successfully resisted his vampiric bloodlust and proved he can control his nature—Donavich experiences a profound emotional upheaval. He realizes his faith was not corrupted, but rather his own loss of faith that prevented him from hearing the Morninglord's voice.

If [[Doru]] is killed, Donavich accepts the news with grim resignation, believing it was mercy.

### Role in the Campaign

After retrieving the holy symbol, Donavich conducts [[Kolyan Indirovich]]'s funeral rites, restoring his connection to the Morninglord. He also warns the players of the superstition about red-haired women bringing bad luck, and suggests the Abbey of St. Markovia in Krezk as a destination of eventual refuge.

## Important Lore

### The Truth About Doru

Doru is not a mindless creature—his soul is very much alive. Though he cannot disobey Strahd's direct commands and though his thirst for blood weighs heavily on his mind, [[Doru]] continues to fight bitterly against his vampiric nature. It was his resistance that allowed his father to entrap him in the undercroft.

When hope rises in him, [[Doru]] calls out to his father, pleading for salvation and forgiveness. Donavich has refused to respond—until the players bring him the truth.

### Holy Symbol Significance

The bronze sunburst that Donavich gave to [[Doru]] is not corrupted. It has served as an anchor for [[Doru]]'s humanity, reminding him of his faith and steeling his will when the vampire's urges rise too strongly. [[Doru]] continues to wear it as both reassurance that they will reconcile and as a tool to resist his dark nature.

Strahd allowed [[Doru]] to keep the symbol as a cruel joke, amused by the irony of a holy symbol worn by the damned.
