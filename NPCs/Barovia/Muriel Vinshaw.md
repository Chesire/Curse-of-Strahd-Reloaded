## Appearance

**In Human Form:**
Muriel appears as an ordinary human woman of indeterminate age. She is unremarkable in appearance—the sort of person one might see in a tavern and forget moments later. She has sharp, intelligent eyes and moves with quiet grace.

**In Raven Form:**
Muriel appears as a standard black raven with distinctive blue-tipped wings. This blue coloring makes her distinctive and recognizable, though most who see it assume it is a natural color variation or assume the lighting is playing tricks on their eyes.

- **Flattery** for her loyalty and dedication to protecting Barovia
- **Sympathy** for her dangerous mission and narrow escapes

- Protect Barovia from Strahd's influence
- Report her findings to the Keepers of the Feather
- Prevent Strahd from discovering the Keepers' involvement
- Earn the trust and respect of those she works with

## Character Information

### Persona

**In Raven Form (Acts I-II):** Muriel appears to be an ordinary (if unusual) raven that has taken an interest in the players. She mimics sounds, reacts to danger, and seems to follow them with unusual intelligence. Players may assume she is Strahd's spy (like other ravens in Barovia) or simply an intelligent animal.

**Upon Revelation:** Muriel is a skilled, professional operative of the Keepers of the Feather. She is pragmatic, intelligent, and completely dedicated to her mission.

**Privately:** Muriel is quietly heroic and genuinely good-hearted. She cares about Barovia's people and sacrifices much for the cause of protecting them.

### Morale in Combat

In her raven form, Muriel avoids direct combat, preferring to flee or hide. In her human form (if revealed), she fights as a skilled rogue, using tactics and stealth rather than direct confrontation.

### Relationships

- **[[Urwin Martikov]]:** Her superior and primary contact within the Keepers
- **[[Ismark Kolyanovich]]:** Whom she observes from afar; she respects his leadership
- **The Players:** Initial subjects of observation; later potential allies
- **[[Strahd von Zarovich]]:** Her greatest enemy and the reason for her dangerous mission

## Background & History

### Origins and the Keepers

Muriel Vinshaw is a member of the **Keepers of the Feather**, a secret organization of wereravens dedicated to protecting the people of Barovia from Strahd's influence. Led by [[Urwin Martikov]] at the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki, the Keepers operate in the shadows, gathering intelligence and providing aid where they can.

Muriel was recruited into the organization and trained as a spy and scout. Her wereraven nature makes her ideal for gathering intelligence—as a raven, she can go places and see things that humans cannot. She is highly skilled in her role and has become invaluable to the organization.

### The Eavesdropping at Tser Pool

As the players make their way toward Tser Pool in Arc C, Muriel—in raven form—attempts to eavesdrop on a meeting between Strahd and Madam Eva. She successfully hears much of Strahd's Tarokka foretelling, including key information about artifacts and the players' roles in the coming conflict.

However, Strahd detects her presence and drives her away, pursuing her with supernatural force. She is struck by silver barbs from a **greater strix**—a creature of Baba Lysaga—and brought down, gravely wounded.

### Meeting the Players in Arc C

The players encounter Muriel crashed on the road toward Tser Pool, with silver barbs embedded in her body. In this state, she has only 1 hit point and cannot fly, regenerate, or transform. A DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check is required to safely remove the barbs without causing unconsciousness.

Once rescued and the barbs removed, Muriel recovers and travels with the players (still in raven form) toward Vallaki, saying her name is "Blue" if asked. She remains concealed about her true nature until she reaches the Blue Water Inn.

### Revelation and Alliance

At the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki, Muriel reveals her true identity to [[Urwin Martikov]] and the players. She provides her intelligence about Strahd's Tarokka reading (though she only heard the first five cards) and becomes a valuable resource for the party.

## Important Information Muriel Learns

In Arc B/C, Muriel learns:
- The general location and disposition of Barovian defenses
- Information about [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]'s leadership and the siege's impact
- Details about Strahd's personal visit to the village
- The existence and nature of [[Doru]] as a vampire spawn

In Arc C, she overhears:
- The first five cards of Madam Eva's Tarokka foretelling of Strahd's fate
- References to three artifacts that will aid in Strahd's defeat
- Strahd's confidence and disdain for mortal resistance

## Special Mechanics

### Regeneration (Wereraven Form Only)

Muriel regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she hasn't taken necrotic damage or bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a silvered weapon since her last turn.

### Shapeshifting

Muriel can polymorph into a raven-humanoid hybrid or into a raven, or back into her human form. Her statistics remain largely the same across forms. Equipment is not transformed with her.

### Mimicry

Muriel can mimic simple sounds she has heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. A creature hearing the sounds can tell they are imitations with a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.

### Vulnerabilities

Muriel is vulnerable to silvered weapons. Silver barbs or weapons cause her to lose regeneration and prevent her from transforming until the silver is removed.

## Campaign Arc

### In Act I (Arc B)

Muriel observes the players and Barovia's defenses in raven form. She does not directly interact with them, though perceptive players might notice her distinctive blue-tipped wings.

### In Act I (Arc C)

Muriel is encountered, rescued, and travels with the party. She remains in raven form and conceals her intelligence, though she helps guide the party and provides subtle aid.

### In Act II and Beyond

Upon revelation at the Blue Water Inn, Muriel becomes a valuable ally and information source. She may travel with the party or work independently to gather intelligence on Strahd's movements and activities.
