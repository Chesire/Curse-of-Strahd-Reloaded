## Appearance

Doru appears as a young man with youthful features strikingly resembling his father, [[Father Donavich]]. However, his transformation is stark: his skin is ghostly pale, his eyes are red and bloodshot, and his clothes are torn and worn. His hair is an unkempt mess of tangles and knots, matted with grime and filth from weeks of imprisonment in the undercroft. Two pointed fangs protrude from his mouth. A bloodstained bronze sunburst—his father's holy symbol—hangs on a leather cord around his neck, resting against his chest. Deep scratches and claw marks cover his arms from his struggles against his own nature.

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance

Doru should inspire:
- **Sympathy** for his desperate struggle against his vampiric nature
- **Mild discomfort** with his occasionally inhuman mannerisms and desperate hunger
- **Endearment** for his clear dedication to his father and [[Gertruda]]
- **Respect** for his extraordinary willpower and refusal to surrender to darkness

### Emotions

Doru most often feels: **grief**, **guilt**, **shame**, **desperation**, **resignation**, and **hope**

### Motivations

Doru wants to:
- Reconcile with his father before it's too late
- Ensure [[Gertruda]] is safe, wherever she may be
- Prove to himself that he is not a monster
- Find redemption, if such a thing is possible for the damned

### Inspirations

When playing Doru, channel:
- **Theon Greyjoy** (*Game of Thrones*) — broken, seeking redemption, haunted by shame
- **Zuko** (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*) — struggling against his nature, seeking redemption
- **Jesse Pinkman** (*Breaking Bad*) — desperate, guilt-ridden, clinging to humanity
- **Steve Harrington** (*Stranger Things*) — trying to be better, protective, loyal

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Doru is a monstrous, bloodthirsty vampire spawn—a creature of darkness and hunger.

**To those he trusts:** Doru is a broken, guilty man desperately trying to avoid hurting those he loves. He carries the weight of his rebellion's failure and the lives it cost.

**Deep down:** Doru is still the bright, zealous young man who led the rebellion, but now trapped in a body that hungers for blood and chained to a master he cannot disobey. He fights this every moment, and that fight is slowly consuming him.

### Morale in Combat

In a direct confrontation, Doru would seek to flee to avoid hurting anyone. However, if his father or [[Gertruda]] were in danger, he would fight with savage determination to protect them, his bonds to humanity giving him strength.

### Relationships

- **[[Father Donavich]]:** His father. Doru loves him deeply and wears his holy symbol as a reminder of their bond. He desperately wants reconciliation but fears his father can never forgive him.
- **[[Gertruda]]:** His betrothed. Doru is consumed with worry for her safety. He feels responsible for her suffering.
- **[[Escher]]:** His oldest friend and fellow vampire spawn. Doru doesn't know where [[Escher]] is or what has become of him, though he suspects the worst.
- **[[Strahd von Zarovich]]:** His master. Doru cannot disobey Strahd's direct commands and can feel the vampire's presence at all times. He despises his servitude.
- **[[Ismark Kolyanovich]]:** A friend from before the rebellion. Doru trained with him in swordsmanship.
- **Dr. Rudolph van Richten:** The disguised vampire hunter who aided the rebellion. Doru's insistence on van Richten's involvement led to the scholar's exposure.

## Background & History

### Before the Rebellion

Doru was a bright, enthusiastic young man who grew up in the shadow of the church. He was enraptured by stories of the sun and the light it once brought to Barovia. As a child, he spent hours listening to tales of the ancient days when the valley was free. As he grew older, he studied swordsmanship with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and devoted himself to *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires*, a book he purchased from a Vistani caravan ten years prior.

His goal was simple but ambitious: to learn how to destroy vampires, so that he might one day free Barovia from Strahd's tyranny.

### The Stranger and the Rebellion

Three months before the siege, a foreign scholar named "Alanik Ray" arrived in Barovia and rented a room at the burgomaster's mansion. Doru quickly befriended him and recognized something unusual about the man—a depth of skill and knowledge that belied his scholar's disguise.

When an enormous undead dire wolf attacked a group of children, "Alanik" fended it off with expert skill. As his hat was knocked off during the battle, his appearance magically shifted, revealing him to be **Dr. Rudolph van Richten**—the legendary vampire hunter himself.

Doru was electrified. He confronted van Richten and insisted that the old man lead the village in revolt against Castle Ravenloft. Though van Richten was reluctant, he eventually agreed—on the condition that Doru allow him to keep his disguise.

Doru then worked with [[Escher]], his oldest friend and the village bard, to assemble more than two dozen fighters. They marched on Castle Ravenloft with hope burning in their hearts and van Richten at their side.

### The Failed Rebellion

The mob struck down the undead guards that tried to stop them. However, when they finally opened Strahd's crypt, they found it empty. More horrifying, [[Escher]] was nowhere to be found.

Moments later, Strahd emerged from the shadows. The vampire lord was faster, stronger, and more terrible than anything the rebels could have imagined. He slaughtered most of them in mere moments, his power overwhelming any resistance.

Doru was captured and turned into a vampire spawn. Over nearly three months at Castle Ravenloft, Strahd repeatedly forced him to drink the blood of his former companions—a sadistic torment designed to break Doru's will and bind him to his master.

### The Undercroft

Six nights ago, Strahd commanded Doru to return to the church and terrorize his father. Doru had no choice—he cannot disobey Strahd's direct orders and can feel his master's presence at all times, like a hook in his mind.

When Doru arrived at the church, he was almost grateful that his father managed to trap him in the undercroft. Here, at least, he couldn't harm the innocent. He has remained imprisoned ever since, using his father's holy symbol as an anchor against the encroaching madness and hunger.

Though he cannot speak to his father from the undercroft, Doru has called out to him repeatedly, pleading for salvation and forgiveness. His father has not answered—until the players arrive.

## Special Mechanics: The Trial of Will

If Doru asks the players to expose him to the scent of fresh blood as a test of his control over his vampiric nature, use the following mechanics:

**Doru Will Remember That:** When the trial begins, secretly place a six-sided die showing 1. Each time the players antagonize or discourage Doru, increase the die by 1. Each time they are encouraging or kind, decrease it by 1 (minimum 0).

When the trial begins, roll another d6. If the result is equal to or greater than the secret die's number, Doru successfully resists his bloodlust. If it's less, he succumbs and must be stopped or killed.

## Important Notes

### Doru's Humanity

Despite his transformation, Doru's soul remains intact. He fights his vampiric nature every moment, and this internal war has slowly strengthened his will. He has learned to retract and expose his fangs at will—a rare ability among vampire spawn that indicates his will is holding back the monster within.

### The Torn Book

Van Richten tore out the preface of Doru's copy of *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires* during a furious argument before the rebellion, leaving the torn page in the burgomaster's guest room as a warning. That page may be found by the players, offering hints about vampire weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

### Strahd's Puppet

Doru cannot disobey Strahd's direct commands. However, he can interpret commands narrowly and resist suggestions. The more hope and kindness shown to him, the more he resists, as love and connection are his anchors to humanity.

## Campaign Arc

### In Act I

Doru remains imprisoned in the church undercroft, a tragic figure awaiting either destruction or redemption. The players must decide his fate.

### Later in the Campaign

If spared, Doru may eventually regain his freedom through clerical magic or the players' intervention. His expertise in vampire lore and his knowledge of Castle Ravenloft (from his time as a prisoner) could prove invaluable to the party.

If reconciled with his father, Doru becomes a powerful symbol of redemption and hope—proof that even the damned can be saved.
