## Appearance

Gertruda is a young woman of twenty-one years, with a hopeful and curious expression.

Her eyes are bright and intelligent, filled with dreams of a world beyond Barovia.

## Roleplaying Information

- **Sympathy** for her naivety and tragic fate
- **Concern** for her missing status and presumed capture
- **Empathy** for her love of [[Doru]] and determination to save him
- **Sadness** for the innocence lost to Strahd's cruelty

### Emotions

Before her capture, Gertruda felt: **hopeful**, **determined**, **idealistic**, **romantic**, **desperate**, and **brave**

(If encountered later in the campaign, she may feel: **traumatized**, **broken**, **resigned**, or **hostile** depending on her treatment)

### Motivations

Gertruda wants to:
- Save [[Doru]] from his fate
- Bring aid to Barovia
- Prove her courage and worth
- Escape her mother's control and prove her independence

### Inspirations

When playing Gertruda, channel:
- **Arwen** (*Lord of the Rings*) — idealistic, determined, willing to sacrifice for love
- **Anne Shirley** (*Anne of Green Gables*) — imaginative, spirited, idealistic
- **Juliet** (*Romeo and Juliet*) — romantic, passionate, willing to defy convention

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Gertruda is a spirited young woman with her head in the clouds. She dreams of adventure and romance, inspired by books and her ideals.

**To those close to her:** Gertruda is determined and courageous, willing to take risks to help those she loves. She is not as naive as she appears.

**Deep down:** Gertruda is terrified of becoming trapped like her mother—widowed and alone in a small village with nothing but memories. She desperately wants to believe that [[Doru]] still lives and that she can save him.

### Morale in Combat

Gertruda is not a fighter. She has no combat training and would flee rather than fight. However, she would stand firm if it meant protecting [[Doru]] or helping someone she loves.

### Relationships

- **[[Mary]]:** Her mother. Gertruda loves her mother but feels suffocated by her overprotectiveness. She rebels against [[Mary's]] control through her actions.
- **[[Doru]]:** Her betrothed. Gertruda loves him deeply and desperately believes he can be saved. The thought of his fate drives her to action.
- **[[Ireena Kolyana]]:** Her friend. They bonded as young girls over the loss of their mothers and share a deep connection.
- **[[Ismark Kolyanovich]]:** A respected leader in her village, though she doesn't know him as well as [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] does.
- **[[Strahd von Zarovich]]:** Her captor; her greatest fear

## Background & History

### Early Life

Gertruda was born to [[Mary]], a widow who raised her alone after her father's death. Her mother was protective and loving, but increasingly fearful as Gertruda grew older. [[Mary]] wanted to keep Gertruda safe within the confines of the village, never venturing beyond its walls.

However, Gertruda's father had been a merchant who filled her childhood with stories of great lords and ladies, diplomatic intrigue, and distant kingdoms. He purchased books from Vistani caravans about nobility, courtly manners, and history. Gertruda devoured these books, dreaming of a world beyond Barovia.

### Meeting Doru

When [[Doru]] came of age, Gertruda found herself drawn to him. He was handsome, passionate, and determined to do something great—to free Barovia from Strahd's curse. To Gertruda, he represented everything she wanted: courage, purpose, and a way out of the village's stagnation.

The two became betrothed, though informally. [[Mary]] was skeptical of the relationship, fearing it would lead to heartbreak (as it would—but not in the way she expected).

### The Siege and Desperation

When [[Doru]] marched to Castle Ravenloft and failed to return, Gertruda was devastated. She fell into depression, convinced that he was dead and that her dreams had died with him.

However, during the siege, Gertruda became convinced that [[Doru]] could still be saved. If she could only reach Vallaki and convince the Burgomaster to send aid, perhaps they could organize a rescue. Perhaps [[Doru]] was imprisoned in Castle Ravenloft, waiting for someone to save him.

This belief became an obsession. She argued furiously with [[Mary]], insisting that they must do something, that [[Doru]] was still alive. [[Mary]] refused to allow her to travel, forbidding her from leaving the village.

### Desperate Flight

The morning the players arrive in Barovia, Gertruda makes a desperate choice. Taking her mother's old horse, Nori, she sets off toward Vallaki alone, convinced that she alone can save [[Doru]].

However, she never reaches Vallaki. As she travels through the Svalich Woods, Strahd's black carriage comes upon her. The Devil himself steps out. Terrified, but unwilling to show fear, Gertruda politely demands that Strahd allow supplies to be delivered to Barovia so the villagers can rebuild.

Strahd appears amused by her courage and her naivety. He invites her to Castle Ravenloft to "discuss reparations further"—an invitation she cannot refuse.

### In Castle Ravenloft

Since her capture, Gertruda has remained in Castle Ravenloft as an "honored guest"—though it has become clear that Strahd has no intention of allowing her to leave. She is confined to her chambers, though she is treated with courtesy and allowed certain freedoms.

Strahd is amused by Gertruda's idealism and her desperate hope that [[Doru]] can be saved. He may use her as leverage against [[Doru]], or he may simply keep her as a curiosity—a mortal who reminds him of what it means to be young and hopeful.

## Campaign Role

### In Act I

Gertruda is reported missing by [[Mary]] during the siege. The players may mount a search for her (which will be unsuccessful) or accept [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark's]] assurance that she is likely lost or dead.

### In Later Acts

If the players journey to Castle Ravenloft, they may encounter Gertruda in the castle's chambers. Her mental state depends on how long she has been a prisoner and how Strahd has treated her. She may be:

- **Still Hopeful:** Believing [[Doru]] can be saved and that the players can help her escape
- **Broken:** Resigned to her fate and believing escape is impossible
- **Corrupted:** Turned to Strahd's service through fear, manipulation, or dark promises
- **Dead:** Having perished in captivity

### Rescue and Redemption

If the players successfully rescue Gertruda, she becomes a valuable source of information about Castle Ravenloft's layout and inhabitants. She may also play a crucial role in [[Doru's]] redemption, as his love for her is one of his strongest anchors to humanity.

## Important Notes

### Tragic Idealism

Gertruda's tragedy is that her idealism and courage, which should be admirable, lead directly to her capture. She believes she can make a difference, and that belief blinds her to the danger she faces. Strahd exploits this mercilessly.

### The Horses

Gertruda took her mother's horse, Nori, when she fled. The horse likely did not survive the encounter with Strahd's carriage and the mists beyond the village. This detail saddens [[Mary]] when she learns of it, adding another layer of loss.

### Connection to Doru

Gertruda's fate is intimately connected to [[Doru's]]. If he is redeemed and freed, he will be desperate to rescue her. If he is killed, her suffering becomes even more senseless and tragic.
