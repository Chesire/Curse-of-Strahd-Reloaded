## Background & History

### Early Life

Kolyan Indirovich is the grandson of Ismark the Great, the legendary warrior-burgomaster of Barovia. Unlike his famous ancestor, Kolyan chose the path of diplomacy and administration rather than martial prowess. He was elected or appointed as burgomaster and served faithfully for many years, earning respect through his wisdom, compassion, and fairness.

### Marriage and Family

Kolyan married Korina Targolova, and together they had [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] as their firstborn son. When Korina became pregnant with a second child, Kolyan was deeply grieved to learn that they would be unable to bear more children after this one. However, Korina died fourteen years before the siege, taking that grief with her.

Around the time of Korina's death—or shortly thereafter—Kolyan found a young girl wandering alone near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft in the Svalich Wood. Rather than turn her away, Kolyan brought her home and raised her as his own daughter. He named her [[Ireena Kolyana]], and she became as beloved to him as [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]. Before her death, Korina had helped bury a chest of mementos for the girl, anticipating she might someday want to know her origins.

### As Burgomaster

Kolyan ruled Barovia with wisdom and compassion. He made decisions carefully, always considering the well-being of his people. He was respected by most villagers, though not universally loved—some considered him too cautious or too soft. When Doru's rebellion occurred three months before the siege, Kolyan was hesitant to support it, fearing it would bring retaliation. His caution proved correct, though it brought him little comfort.

### During the Siege

When Strahd's undead siege began, Kolyan was wounded early in the assault, sustaining injuries to his stomach, forehead, and knee. Despite his injuries, he continued to support the village's defense and provide leadership. He remained optimistic, though privately, he feared the worst.

### The Last Night

On the night Strahd personally visited the village, Kolyan invited the vampire into his home—though he was compelled to do so by Strahd's supernatural power of suggestion. As Strahd entered, he attacked without warning, delivering a mortal wound with an elegant slash across Kolyan's chest. 

Kolyan's death was swift. In his final moments, he heard his daughter Ireena scream and heard Strahd's voice murmur, "We shall meet again." Kolyan died knowing that the vampire had marked his beloved daughter, unable to prevent it or protect her.

### Legacy

After his death, Kolyan is buried with proper rites at the Barovian cemetery. His funeral is attended by many villagers who respected him, including [[Father Donavich]], [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], and [[Ireena Kolyana]]. The players assist in digging and preparing his grave.

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] inherits the burden of the burgomaster's responsibilities, though the village is now grievously weakened. Kolyan's death serves as a turning point in the campaign—a moment when the stakes become personal and the players understand the true danger they face.

## Character Insights

### Tactical Thinking

Kolyan was a careful strategist. When the players visit the burgomaster's mansion, he asks them to consider why Strahd's undead forces attack in scattered waves rather than all at once, and why hundreds of undead remain in the woods rather than immediately overwhelming the village. His questions hint at Strahd's orchestration of events and his control of the siege.

### Letters of Introduction

If the players impress Kolyan with their tactical insight or demonstrate genuine interest in helping, he offers to draft a **Letter of Introduction** to other settlements in the valley (Vallaki and Krezk). This letter requests that the recipients offer the players aid and assistance. The letter bears the wax sigil of the burgomaster: a longsword before a rising sun.
