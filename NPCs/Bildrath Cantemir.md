## Appearance

Bildrath is a squat man with greasy, receding salt-and-pepper hair. He has a weathered face that shows the wear of many years of worry and hard living. A perpetual scowl mars his features.

- Protect his nephew [[Parriwimple]] at any cost
- Keep his store and livelihood intact
- Survive the ordeal with Strahd
- Make sense of why his family was taken while he survived

### Inspirations

When playing Bildrath, channel:
- **Davos Seaworth** (*Game of Thrones*) — weathered, pragmatic, protective, cynical
- **Hound** (*Game of Thrones*) — gruff, bitter, but honorable
- **Scrooge McDuck** (*DuckTales*) — miserly, protective of family, cynical

## Character Information

### Persona

**To the world:** Bildrath is a cynical, gruff merchant who cares only about profit and survival. He speaks harshly and often, spitting out bitter truths about the state of the world.

**To those he trusts:** Bildrath is a grieving man desperate to keep his nephew safe. Beneath the gruffness lies genuine care and a fierce protective instinct.

**Deep down:** Bildrath blames himself for surviving when his sister didn't. He carries guilt that he couldn't save Marta and Dragomir, and he channels that guilt into a need to protect [[Parriwimple]].

### Morale in Combat

In a fight, Bildrath would try to avoid combat if possible, preferring to preserve himself and [[Parriwimple]]. However, if [[Parriwimple]] were threatened, he would fight with surprising ferocity, abandoning his usual pragmatism for protective rage.

### Relationships

- **[[Parriwimple]]:** His nephew. Bildrath is gruff with him but deeply protective. The boy is the only family he has left.
- **Marta:** His sister (deceased). Bildrath blames himself for not convincing her to flee the village.
- **Dragomir:** His brother-in-law (deceased). He died alongside Marta during the siege.
- **[[Ismark Kolyanovich]]:** The man Bildrath blames for his family's death. He called [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] "Ismark the Lesser" in mockery of his failed leadership.
- **The Players:** Potential allies, depending on how they treat him and [[Parriwimple]]

## Background & History

### Before the Siege

Bildrath ran a successful general store in Barovia, Bildrath's Mercantile. He had a simple life focused on commerce and profit. His sister Marta was married to Dragomir, and they had a son together: [[Parriwimple]].

Bildrath was moderately fond of his family, though he kept his distance and focused primarily on his business. When Doru's rebellion occurred, Bildrath wanted to flee the village—he believed the whole endeavor was foolish and doomed.

### The Turning Point

When Ismark delivered his inspiring speech invoking his great-grandfather's legacy, many villagers were moved to stay and defend their homes. But Bildrath wanted to leave. However, his sister Marta, moved by the speech and Ismark's genuine passion, convinced her husband Dragomir that they should stay and fight.

Unable to abandon his family, Bildrath reluctantly stayed as well. He told himself it was temporary—that surely the village would fall, and then they could leave.

### During the Siege

The siege lasted six nights. Each night, Bildrath watched the undead assault the barricades. And each night, more villagers fell. On the second night, Marta and Dragomir were killed during a particularly fierce assault. They died for [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark's]] "foolish fantasy of heroism."

Bildrath's world collapsed. He survived while his sister—the only family he truly had besides [[Parriwimple]]—was slaughtered. He was left to raise his young nephew alone, a boy who had just lost both his parents.

### Current State

Bildrath is consumed by guilt and rage. He blames [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] for his family's death, though rationally he knows that Ismark didn't kill them—the undead did. He calls [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] "Ismark the Lesser" in bitter mockery, and he publicly declares that the village is doomed and that resistance is futile.

He runs his store with a cynical eye toward profit, charging exorbitant prices. However, he has a soft spot for those who treat him and [[Parriwimple]] with kindness, and he reduces prices for those who show genuine compassion.

Most importantly, he is fiercely protective of [[Parriwimple]]. The boy is all he has left, and Bildrath would do anything to keep him safe—even stand alongside the players against the undead.

## Merchant Relations

### Pricing

Bildrath normally charges 10 times the listed price for items in the *Player's Handbook*. However:
- If players are kind to him, he charges only twice the normal price
- If players defend [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] to him, he charges five times the normal price out of spite
- If players show particular kindness to [[Parriwimple]], he might even sell items at normal price

### Relationship Development

If the players treat Bildrath and [[Parriwimple]] with respect and kindness throughout the siege and beyond, Bildrath's cynicism may gradually soften. He may eventually become a genuine ally, though his bitterness will remain a part of his character.
