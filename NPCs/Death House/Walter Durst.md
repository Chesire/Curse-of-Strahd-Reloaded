## Character Information

### Persona

Walter is a tragic figure—an innocent infant caught in the dark magic and family tragedy surrounding Death House. He has no agency or will of his own, existing only as a tool bound to [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth's]] command.

### Relationships

- **[[Elisabeth Durst]]:** His half-sister or mother figure (his paternity is unclear). [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth]] has bound him through dark magic and the amber shard
- **[[Gustav Durst]]:** His father
- **[[Klara]]:** His mother
- **[[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]]:** His half-siblings

## Background & History

Walter was born to [[Klara]] the nursemaid and [[Gustav Durst]], the master of Death House. His existence became a symbol of [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth's]] husband's infidelity and shame.

[[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth]] bound Walter's spirit and remains to Death House through dark necromantic magic. The blood-red runes carved around the crypt bearing Walter's name mark this dark binding. Walter's corpse was used as a focal point for the creation of the Flesh Mound—a bloated, grotesque creature animated by his bound spirit and the malevolent will of [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth]].

A severed human finger found beneath Walter's crib bears toothmarks, suggesting the violence surrounding his existence. The crib itself has the name "Walter" lovingly carved into its head—a stark contrast to the horror of the dark magic surrounding him.

Walter exists as a prisoner within his own transformed body, crying from within the Flesh Mound. His spirit can be heard whimpering from within the mound's bulk when creatures are engulfed.

## The Flesh Mound

Walter's spirit animates the two-phase creature known as the Flesh Mound. His corpse serves as the creature's "heart" in its second form, with the inscription "Innocent Heart" describing his role. Walter's corpse has AC 15 and shares the same ability scores as the Flesh Mound. Each time Walter's corpse takes damage, the Flesh Mound takes twice as much damage.

The creature can be temporarily commanded through the amber shard found in the Master Suite. When presented with the shard and spoken to by name with conviction, the Flesh Mound will obey commands if the speaker succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) check.

## The Lullaby

The Flesh Mound recognizes the melody of *Waltz for Klara*, the harpsichord piece hidden in the Conservatory. A player who hums or plays this piece and succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check can force the Flesh Mound to expose its heart (containing Walter), preventing it from using its *withdraw* reaction until the start of that player's next turn.
