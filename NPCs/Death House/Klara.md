## Background & History

In life, Klara was a nursemaid employed by the Durst family to care for their children [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]]. She had a relationship with the master of the household, [[Gustav Durst]], and became pregnant with his child, [[Walter Durst|Walter]].

Klara wrote a letter asking for leave from her duties, expressing that she felt she had become part of the Durst family and hoped to bring another family member into the world. However, her pregnancy and affair with Gustav was discovered by [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth]], who flew into a jealous rage.

[[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth]] tortured Klara for weeks before finally allowing her to die of starvation. Her tortured corpse was found in a storage trunk in the attic, bearing wounds consistent with the scarring seen on her spirit.

A lace piece bearing the initial "K" was hidden in the kitchen pantry alongside a note signed "G." A piece of child's needlework in the Den of Wolves was embroidered with "FOR MISS KLARA," though the young woman's face in the image had been slashed and cut out.

## The Mirror in Nursemaid's Suite

Klara's spirit can be encountered as an apparition in the mirror in the Nursemaid's Suite. She can neither speak aloud nor exit the mirror, but she can answer basic questions by nodding or shaking her head. If asked for aid in reaching the basement or finding the monster, she steps aside—vanishing from sight—and the secret door behind the mirror slowly opens. The spirit does not return after opening the door.
